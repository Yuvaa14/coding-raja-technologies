Father of Artificial intelligence
John McCarthy is considered as the father of Artificial Intelligence. 
John McCarthy was an American computer scientist.
The term "artificial intelligence" was coined by him.
Description: Develop a system that can detect and track objects of interest in video streams using deep learning.

Steps:

1.Data Collection: Gather a dataset of videos containing the objects you want to detect and track.
2.Data Preprocessing: Extract video frames and annotate them with bounding boxes around objects.
3.Model Selection: Choose an object detection model like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN.
4.Model Training: Train the chosen model on the annotated frames to recognize objects.
5.Real-time Detection: Implement the model to detect objects in real-time video streams.
6.Object Tracking: Use techniques like Kalman filters or optical flow to track detected objects across frames.
7.Visualization: Visualize the detected and tracked objects in the video.
Tech Stack:

Python
Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
Computer vision libraries (OpenCV)
